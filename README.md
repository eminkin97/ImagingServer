#Autonomous Drone Imaging System:

Always make sure you pull before you start working!

### System to-do list:

- [X] fix app crashes
- [X] fix input trigger error (trigger time not actual time)
- [ ] add geotagging
- [ ] allow for smooth scroll with lot of pics on site ( site freezing)
- [X] heartbeat problems (i.e. randomly disconnects) : fixed by using Chrome :)
- [ ] make to fit competition rules: able to fill out target sheet (Ask me if you don't get this)
- [ ] can still be made even better...always true :)
