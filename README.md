#Autonomous Drone Imaging System:


	Fixing: 
	
	Django Image Server has some of  the following problems:
	
		-phone sometimes disconnects due to connection check delay
		
		-Doesn't work FLAWLESSLY
		
	Android Camera App:
	
		-haven't chosen an ideal heartbeat rate, related to point one in the django list above
		
		-Still has some operational bugs, i.e. this is things like freezing
		
		-Doesn'twork FLAWLESSLYg
		
	Integrate Normal Geotagging
		
		- to ground station
	
	Overall Imaging:
	
		-***Not fit to competition specifics***
		
	-> remember the above two things, you shouldn't have to thing twice about
