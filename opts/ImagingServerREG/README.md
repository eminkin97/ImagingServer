# Imaging Server
#Autonomous Drone Imaging System:

TODO List: Please fork before contributing
	- [ ] integrate new geotagging:
		- see TODO on line 141 of ImagingServer/server/models.py
		- do tests externally, as it might be difficult to set up the server
	- [ ] fix up gui:
		- buttons and inputs need to be formatted correctly
	- [ ] deployment:
		- still need to test again and possibly fix deployment to apache with HTTPS
